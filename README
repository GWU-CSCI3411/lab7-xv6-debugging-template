# 1. Introduction

In this lab, we will be discussing some best practices for debugging code that you might be writing for the next few assignments and the final project. Debugging in xv6 is a bit more complicated than regular debugging, so it's important that you know the right way to approach different types of problems. If you debug properly, you'll end up saving yourself a LOT of time.

# 2. sh.c Walkthrough

Work in groups with students near you. Try to answer the following questions. Your instructor will be calling on each group to answer one or more of the questions. There is much more to understand in this file, but this exercise is a good warm-up.

*   What is the `open()` call on line 146 doing?
*   What is the console?
*   When you provide a command without arguments, where do we end up creating the child program?
*   What does `fork1()` do?

# 3. Good Developer Practices

This section is presented by your instructor on the slides. The slides will be made available following the last lab section.

# 4. Review `exit()` in proc.c

What does `exit()` actually do? Let's break it down. Your instructor will run through the demo. If you miss lab, it is *highly* encouraged to take the time to make sure you understand what this method does.

# 7. xv6 Debugging Exercises

For each of these exercises, work with the students near you to determine:

1.  What is going wrong, and
2.  How to fix the program or system call so it works properly.

## 1. Traps

Compile and start xv6 (`make qemu-nox`). Run `ex1.c`. Notice that you receive a number of trap errors. What is causing them?

## 2. Happy Halloween!

Compile and start xv6 (`make qemu-nox`). Run `ex2.c`. Where are the zombies coming from?

## 3. Panic!

Compile and start xv6 (`make qemu-nox`). Run `ex3.c`. What causes this panic error?

## 4. More Panic!

Compile and start xv6 (`make qemu-nox`). Run `ex4.c`. What causes this panic error?
